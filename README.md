# FitTrack

This application was created as a side project for studying Flutter.
It uses Firebase for storage, which makes it usable right from the get-go.

The application can be used to track workouts, and compare them to one another. Comparing uses Cross-multiplication of total weight moved to assess workout performance. Individual exercises are compared to one another, while overall performance is calculated as well. This project is done for now, but I might update it in the future depending if I can start using it regularly and need some more functionality, or I want to publish it on the app store.
